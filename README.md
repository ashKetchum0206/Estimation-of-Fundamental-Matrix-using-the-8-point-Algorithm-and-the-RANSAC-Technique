# Estimation-of-Fundamental-Matrix-using-the-8-point-Algorithm-and-the-RANSAC-Technique

The fundamental matrix is used to calibrate an uncalibrated stereo system. This matrix is obtained using 8 correspondences between  
the 2 pictures. The 8 point algorithm is then used to estimate the fundamental matrix. The RANSAC iterative technique is employed
to improve the results.
